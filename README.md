# Welcome to My Portfolio

## Description

I built this portfolio Page from scratch, attempting to utilize semantic HTML and dry code - let me know how I did! - using only images I generated with Midjourney was an additional challenge I set for myself. Another goal for this page was a responsive design. The landing features my nav items, though, the page is so short they seem a little ridiculous. Every element was something I needed to study and tinker with, but I'm pretty content with the content. The "Projects" section currently features three items, each of which was a group project from the UC Berkley / EdX coding bootcamp.


## Installation

git clone git@github.com:JaKrau/Bogles.git

## Usage

The site features three nav items, use these or scroll down to view all content.
