# Welcom to My Portfolio

## Description

I built this portfolio Page from scratch, attempting to utilize semantic HTML and dry code - let me know how I did! - using only images I generated with Midjourney was an additional challenge I set for myself. Another goal for this page was accessability/scalability, I don't know if I'm set on the current settings for mobile displays, but I can say that it does scale down!  The landing features my nav items, though, the page is so short they seem a little ridiculous. Every element was something I needed to practice, study, and tinker with, but I'm pretty content with the content. The "Projects" section currently features three items, though, only one of the links is my own. (the other two are "example.com" simply for a lack of projects)


## Installation

git clone git@github.com:JaKrau/Bogles.git

## Usage

The site features three nav items, use these or scroll down to view all content.
